      <h3>Monitor Jenkins closely |For DevOps</h3>
      <p>
        Deployment is a daily task for any DevOps, and Jenkins is considered the primary tool in CI/CD where all flow must go through it. However when we work in a big team we run multiple jobs at the same time also itâ€™s possible can schedule others to be run later, this may affect Jenkins performance, and jobs will be running slowly
